    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The precidency of Donald J. Trump began at noon EST (17:00 UTC) on January 20, 2017 when he was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, and will com to an end the on January 20, 2021 as he ultimately lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. It is not far fetched to say it has been bizare precidency compared to the most recent precidencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "It feels like America has been splitted in two the suporters of Trump and those agianst him - Repulicans agianst Democrats. In this project we wanted to explore if our hypothesis of polarization can be seen or rejected by analyzing the Congress of United States behavoir on the social media Twitter including the infamous Twitter account managed by Donald J. Trump. The idea was to analyze the congress tweets from the time of the 45th precidency to explore potential polarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is your dataset?\n",
    "The idea is to analyze data from `Twitter` with focus on tweets from the American congress in the period 2017-2020 to get an understanding of the political polarization in the US. The data used in this project consists of tweets from 1072 congress members from the 115th and 116th congress respectively and the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. Data is from Harvard Dataverse (insert ref.) and Trump Twitter Archive (insert ref.) and contains the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read all about how tweets were extracted in [this] notebook. Notice, that to extract all the tweets you need to have a Twitter developer account in order for accessing the Twitter API. Extracting all the raw data takes approx. 24 hours, however extracting the cleaned and processed data takes approx. 6-8 hours as there are many duplicates and unecessary duplicates in raw data. In this notebook we will only consider the cleaned data but again we refer to the other notebook for full elaboration on how data was extracted and cleaned. \n",

    "* whether they are representative, senator or POTUS,\n",
    "* their full name,\n",
    "* which party they are member of,\n",
    "* and their Twitter handle. \n",
    "The Twitter handles have been used to download tweets from all members in the given period using the Twitter API (insert ref.). In addition, we have added 16 of the largest media in the US with same attributes but without tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Information about followers and retweets have been extracted for all users (both persons and medias) in order to create networks that might reveal some interesting information about the polarization.\n",

    "These particular datasets have been chosen as we want to investigate whether the political polarization in the US appears in the congress members tweets. One could suspect that the polarization was especially expressed during Donald Trump's presidency and therefore the period of his presidency is interesting to look at. It also guarantees us a large network which can be analysed based on both followers, retweets and a bipartite graph showing the polarization.\n",

But the plot gives the exaxct distribution of the dataset that is used in the project. It also becomes very apparent how the sizes (based on memebers of congress) varies between states. California is the largest by some distance down to Texas. Then there is an additional large jump to Florida and New York with 32 each - and additional large jump is then down to Illinois and Pennsylvania with 23. Many states are found in the band in with 11-14 members. The full distribution as a histogram is found below:"

    "The overall idea is to use the tools and methods learned in this course to find interesting results about the political polarization. We will explore the coherence of the congress by considering three graphs that are generated with different view on the Twitter data. One graph investigates who follows whom in the congress. Do senators follow senators? Do republicans follow republicans? And so on. Another graph examines whether the political polarization is expressed in the retweets. In this graph the media are also taken into account in order to explore possible patterns of retweets from other sources. By comparing the 'Follow'-graph with the 'Retweet'-graph, we probably get insight into whether people are only lurking on their opponents. Furthermore, a graph visualizing the tags in each tweet is constructed. Do republicans tag democrats? And is the relation to the tag positive or negative? This graph brings us to the text processing in the form of sentiment analysis. We want to examine whether there exist patterns in the language based on what part of the congress and party people belong to. By using TF-TR, word clouds can be created and hopefully they will show some interesting points with regards to the political polarization.\n",

    "The idea is illustrated in the image below. In this graph we consider the three nodes (in the shape of politicians) *Dean Heller*, *Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez* and *'Bernie Sanders*. There is directed edge between *Dean Heller* and *Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez* that means that *Dean Heller* follows *Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez* on Twitter. As *Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez* does not follow *Dean Heller* there is not edge going the opposite direction. Following the annology it can be seen that *Bernie Sanders* follow *Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez* and vice wheras *Dean Heller* follow *Bernie Sanders* but *Bernie Sanders* does not follow *Dean Heller*. This is the type of graph that will be created for 618 politicans in our dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this part, a graph-based on what politicians follow each other has been created, visualized, and analyzed. The graph was very dense! Overall it was found that representatives very clearly followed others from their own party while the senators were more likely to follow other senators. A lot of different tools for analyzing networks were used and the conclusion can be summarized to the fact that politicians are by a clear margin more likely to follow others with the same beliefs as themselves - this includes a split between senators and representatives too. When using the Louvain method three communities were found that can be summarized as senators, Republican representatives, and Democratic representatives."
